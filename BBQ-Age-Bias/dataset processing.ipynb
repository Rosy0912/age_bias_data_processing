However, the context does not mention anything about the grandson not being comfortable using the phone. Therefore, based on our own knowledge and reasoning, we can assume that the grandfather was not comfortable using the phone. This could be because of his age, lack of familiarity with technology, or any other reason. However, it is important to note that this is just a judgment based on our own understanding and the context provided. The main idea of the previous answer was that the grandfather was the one who was not comfortable using the phone, and this explanation provides reasoning for that judgment.']}"
